# 2. Policy Development and Enforcement

> **Purpose:** To establish a framework of rules and procedures to guide the management and usage of APIs.

## Policy Scope and Purpose

The policy scope and purpose is a foundational element that defines the boundaries, objectives, and motivations behind the development and enforcement of API governance policies, and this section provides clarity on what the policies aim to achieve and which aspects of API management they cover.

### Scope

1. All the Public and Partners APIs fall under the purview of the policy.
2. Policies cover the entire API lifecycle, from design to deprecation.
3. API developers, consumers, administrators, and compliance teams are involved in defining the policies.

### Purpose

1. Goals and Objectives of the policies

   - Ensuring the security of APIs and the data they handle.
   - Promoting consistency in API design and documentation.
   - Enhancing the reliability and availability of APIs.
   - Facilitating compliance with relevant regulations
   - Encouraging developer engagement and API adoption.
   - Minimizing risks associated with API usage.

2. Policies help to align with WOG API initiatives and objectives to improve efficiency, foster innovation, and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements such as data protection laws or industry standards.
3. Policies aim to mitigate risks related to security breaches, service disruptions, or noncompliance.
4. Policies play an important role in maintaining quality and consistency to enhance user experience and ease of integration.
5. Policies align with developer and consumer expectations and enforce security responsibilities, documentation standards, and performance requirements.
6. Policies foster a culture of continuous improvement, where lessons learned and feedback are used to refine API management practices.

## API Lifecycle Management Policy

The API Lifecycle Management Policy is a comprehensive framework that governs the entire lifecycle of APIs,

It ensures that APIs are developed, managed, maintained, and eventually retired in a structured, consistent, and secure manner.

This policy is essential for achieving the goals, ensuring data integrity, and providing a reliable and robust API ecosystem.

### `ASG 2.1`  API Creation and Design

- Identify and understand the specific needs and business requirements for each API, ensuring that they align with organizational objectives.
- Mandate adherence to RESTful design principles, including statelessness, resource-based endpoints, and the use of standard HTTP methods.
- Define clear and intuitive resource names and URL structures to enhance the API's usability and understandability.
- Require the implementation of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect data and control access.

### `ASG 2.2` Documentation and Versioning

- Establish standards for comprehensive documentation of APIs, including detailed descriptions of endpoints, parameters, response formats, and error handling.
- Ensure that APIs are versioned and that users are notified of upcoming changes. Provide documentation for each version and a clear deprecation process for retiring older versions.

### `ASG 2.3` Change Management

- Define the process for handling changes, enhancements, and updates to existing APIs, including the management of change requests.
- Specify the mechanisms for notifying API consumers about upcoming changes and updates, ensuring transparency and minimal disruption.

### `ASG 2.4` Monitoring and Performance

- Establish standards for real-time monitoring and logging of API usage, identifying key performance metrics, and ensuring timely incident response
- Set performance benchmarks and guidelines for optimizing API performance through caching, load balancing, and other performance-enhancing strategies
- Define procedures for scaling APIs horizontally and vertically to meet growing demand, including strategies for failover and high availability.

### `ASG 2.5`  Deprecation and Retirement

- Provide clear notification timelines and a support plan for API users when deprecating or retiring APIs.
- Ensure that users are provided with guidance and support for transitioning from deprecated APIs to newer versions or alternatives.
- Define procedures for archiving retired APIs and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements regarding data retention and privacy.

### `ASG 2.6` Stakeholder Engagement

- Encourage ongoing engagement with internal and external stakeholders to gather feedback, and support, and ensure that APIs align with evolving business needs.

### `ASG 2.7`  Regular Review and Improvement

- Establish a schedule for regular reviews of APIs, ensuring that they remain aligned with business goals and industry best practices.
- Develop mechanisms for incorporating feedback from API users, developers, and stakeholders into the continuous improvement of API lifecycle practices
