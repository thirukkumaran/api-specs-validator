# 9. Community and Developer Engagement

Engage your Developers and the Community

> **Purpose:** To communicate strategies and practices to ensure effective interaction with the developer community, both internal and external to the organization.

## 9.1 Use of API Marketplace

### `ASG 9.1.1` List APIs unto API Marketplace / API Catalog

Have the APIs listed unto the a private catalog for other Agencies to consumer, and/or public API marketplace for Businesses to consume.

This is to allow users to discover the APIs and be able to request to try the APIs in a test environment.

The use of an API Marketplace could have the added advantage to be able to:

- save effort on the side of Publishers to create and operate a developer's portal
- allow Publishers to control who is authorized to test the APIs
- allow Publishers to allow access to Consumers who have passed conformance testing
- allow Consumers to have a consolidated catalog to find the APIs they need
- allow Consumers to request for the APIs they wish to test
- allow the release and rotation of API Keys/credentials to Consumers for authentication

<br></br>

## 9.2 Open Communication Channels

Create and maintain platforms and methods for communication that are accessible and efficient for all stakeholders, especially the developer community.

a. Establish dedicated forums or discussion boards where developers can post questions, share knowledge, and discuss API-related topics. This can be a part of Gitlab forums.

b. Implement chat platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams, where developers can have real-time conversations, share instant feedback, and get quick responses from peers or API support teams.

c. Host periodic STACK events and demo sessions where developers can learn about new features, and best practices, and have their questions answered by experts in real-time.

d. Establish and Use tools like GitHub or GitLab, not just for code sharing but also for bug tracking, feature requests, and open discussions on development-related topics.

e. Maintain a blog that not only shares updates and tutorials but also allows for comments and discussions. This can be a platform for more in-depth articles and thought leadership content.

f. Regularly distribute surveys or feedback forms to gather insights on API usage, challenges faced by developers, and suggestions for improvements.

## 9.3 Documentation and Educational Resources

Create a comprehensive and user-friendly suite of resources that help developers understand, implement, and effectively use your API.

a. Ensure the API documentation is thorough, up-to-date, and easy to navigate. This includes detailed descriptions of all endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, error codes, and examples. Interactive documentation using tools like Swagger can enhance the user experience by allowing developers to test API calls directly from the documentation.

b. Develop a range of tutorials and guides for different levels of developers, from beginners to advanced. These should cover basic setup, common use cases, best practices, and complex integrations, providing step-by-step instructions and code samples.

c. Create video content that demonstrates how to use the API. This can include recorded webinars, walkthroughs of key features, and coding sessions. Videos are beneficial for visual learners and can make complex topics more accessible.

d. Provide sample applications and libraries in various programming languages that demonstrate the API's capabilities. These samples can serve as starting points for developers and help them understand practical implementation.

e. Maintain a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that addresses common queries and challenges faced by developers. This section should be regularly updated based on the feedback and inquiries received.

f. Facilitate a section within community forums where developers can ask questions and share insights related to the API. Peer-to-peer support can be invaluable for problem-solving and idea generation.

g. Provide a sandbox environment where developers can experiment with the API without affecting live data. This is crucial for testing and understanding the API in a risk-free setting.

## 9.4 Open Source Contributions and Collaborations

Create a supportive environment for community-driven development and innovation.

a. Host API's code, or parts of it, on open-source platforms like GitHub or GitLab. This allows developers to directly contribute to the codebase, suggest features, or fix bugs.

b. Clearly define how external contributors can participate. This includes setting up guidelines for submitting issues, pull requests, code style guides, and the process for reviewing and accepting contributions.

c. Encourage and support projects led by the community that extend or enhance APIs. This could be through providing resources, mentorship, or even financial support.

d. Organize or sponsor hackathons and coding competitions that challenge developers to build applications using APIs. This not only stimulates innovation but also uncovers potential improvements or new use cases for your API.

e. Recognize and reward community members who make significant contributions. This could be through public acknowledgements, swag, or even direct involvement in decision-making processes related to the API.

f. Adopt and contribute to open standards and protocols in the API community. This helps in aligning your API with industry best practices and fosters interoperability.

g. Host or sponsor meetups and events focused on open-source development. Use these platforms for networking, knowledge sharing, and discussing your API with the open-source community.

h. Involve the community in the roadmap planning process for APIs. This could be done through surveys, community calls, or public forums where users can suggest and vote on new features.

i. Actively advocate for open-source development within GovTech and in the wider tech community. This involves highlighting the benefits of open collaboration and supporting policies that foster open-source contributions.
